This is a 2D game made by Unity when I was in university

This document will introduce the basic operation in the game.

After entering the game, use the A/D keys to control the character's left and right movement, space to control the character jump, the height of the jump is related to the length of the key, the longer the time the higher the jump.

S key for the character low speed mode, press and hold S while moving left and right, the character movement speed will be reduced, while showing the character's judgment point.

Left mouse button click, the character will launch bullet attack, launch direction is the direction of the mouse.

The bottom left corner is the character's three skills, use Q/E to switch left/right of the rune card, long press the right mouse button to build up power and use the middle skill, the character's speed will be reduced during the building up of power.
